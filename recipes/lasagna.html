        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
            <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in 
                a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.
            </li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 
                tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 
                2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, 
                Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, 
                covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.
            </li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. 
                Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.
            </li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 
                2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the 
                bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles 
                lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the 
                ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella 
                cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over 
                mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.
            </li>
            <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and 
                Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, 
                either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the 
                foil does not touch the cheese.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the 
                foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
            </ol>
